# ResplendentTools
A standalone BotBase for the RebornBuddy FFXIV MMO bot to craft the Resplendent Tools.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

 * Trusts unlocked (in Patch 5.3, level 71 combat class + Holminster Switch unlocked)
 * [RebornBuddy][0] with active license (paid)
 * [LlamaLibrary][1] botbase (free)
 * [Lisbeth][2] with active license (paid)

## Setup

 1. Download the [latest version][4].
 2. On the `.zip` file, right click > `Properties` > `Unblock` > `Apply`.
 3. Unzip all contents into `RebornBuddy\BotBases\` so it looks like this:
```
RebornBuddy
└── BotBases
    └── ResplendentTools
```
 4. Start RebornBuddy as normal.

## Suggested settings
 This was written during Shadowbringers with crafting item level 490.
 It is suggested to run this with penta-melded aesthete gear and Lisbeth consumables set to use Chili Crab HQ and Cunning Craftsman's Syrup HQ.
